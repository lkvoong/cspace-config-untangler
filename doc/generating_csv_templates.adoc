= Generating CSV templates

CSV templates are useful in preparing data for ingest via CspaceBatchImport, by:

- providing the proper structure and column naming to ensure fields will be imported properly
- indicating whether each field is required
- indicating which (if any) repeatable field group each field is part of (so you can see which fields repeat together)
- for fields populated with terms from a static list, providing a list of the allowable system values

== To generate CSV templates: 

This will create CSV templates for each profile in a separate subdirectory of `data/templates/release_#`:

`exe/ccu mappers write -p all -o data/templates/release_# -s y`

For details on the options:

`exe/ccu templates help write`
